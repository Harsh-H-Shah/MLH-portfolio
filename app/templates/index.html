  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Harsh Shah</strong>, a passionate software engineer and MSCS
    candidate at <strong>Stony Brook University</strong> (Class of 2026) with a
    strong foundation in full-stack development, data engineering, and AI
    systems. I've built award-winning projects such as
    <a href="https://github.com/harsh-h-shah/HealthSynopsis" target="_blank"
      >HealthSynopsis</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/Harsh-H-Shah/ZapMap" target="_blank">ZapMap</a>
    that apply AI and scalable systems to solve real-world problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I interned at Aumsat Technologies and Skinzy Software, where I
    worked on Python/Flask backends and React.js frontends to build systems with
    real-time data processing and impactful UI. I'm also a hackathon enthusiast
    — winner of
    <strong>Smart India Hackathon 2022</strong>,
    <strong>HopperHacks 2025</strong>, and <strong>HackNYU 2025</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of code, I love photography, gaming, and exploring new places —
    you'll find some of that in the hobbies section! I enjoy collaborating with
    communities and have led 14+ technical events as part of
    <strong>Google Developer Student Clubs</strong> and
    <strong>TSEC CodeCell</strong>.
  </p>
